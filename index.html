      <p>My name is Mi'Keyrah Stewart-Tate. I am the CEO and founder of <em><strong>Stewart-Tate & Co</strong>.</em>I was born and raised in Jackson, Ga. I am 23 years old, I am also a mother to my only child and I just got married to my husband in June 2021. I am currently in school for my Bachelors in Web Design. I started <em><strong>Stewart-Tate and Co</strong>
    </em>. because once I became a mother, I decided to look more into the ingredients that my baby was using and after I seen some toxic ingredients from well known brands, I decided to make an organic bath and body products. I will also be adding my portfolio of my websites so that customers that need a website produced for them at a resonable price.</td>
